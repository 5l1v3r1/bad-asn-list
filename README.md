# Bad ASN list

List of bad Autonomous System Numbers (ASN) to block possible automated botnets.

Access from these ASNs _shouldn't_ be average users. This list isn't foolproof, as some users may be running their own VPN from a digitalocean droplet, for example, but this list is meant to be an educational guide for blocking bad actors.

## Usage

Do not use without reviewing your network traffic, or if you don't understand the dangers of using this list.
